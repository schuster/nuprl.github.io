% Todo: 
% - Set up URLs for oddball stuff on shivers.com.
% - booktitle vs title in proceedings
% - Ties ~ on author initials?
% - {Scheme} or {S}cheme?
% - crosscheck with physical copies where I have them
%   and mark these entries as checked. A picky thing to check:
%   is it "fifth," "5th" or "$5^{\mathrm th}$" in the conf title?
% - Add individual bibdate field for each record.

% This file contains BibTeX entries for all of my technical work.
% 
% - *All* of it. Should have every single thing I've ever published in
%   any way, shape, or form, from the trivial to the profound, taking a
%   very liberal definition of "published."
% 
% - It isn't split out by journal articles vs. conferences vs. little working
%   notes; it's listed mostly in reverse chronological order. 
% 
% - I have tried to be comprehensive in the information provided: page numbers,
%   ISBN's for the proceedings, everything.
%   
%   In general, anything I do to make these listings better -- better BibTeX
%   hackery, more accurate info, more fields -- is useful for anyone who cites
%   my papers. On the basis of this "multiplier" benefit, please send me
%   corrections or improvements to these listings.
% 
% - Because there is so much information listed for an entry, you may find
%   that your bib style renders these extra fields into references that are
%   cluttered or ugly. If so, just "comment" out the field providing the
%   unwanted info in your bibtex file by prefixing the field name with "OPT"
%   or "X" ("OPT" appears to be the standard prefix for this trick).
% 
%   Some fields are already marked with these OPT prefixes. Feel free to 
%   kill the prefix and turn the fields back on, as you like.
% 
% - The claim to reverse-chronological order above notwithstanding, this file
%   is broken into two parts. Every conference paper herein is listed using a
%   "crossref" field to link it to its containing proceedings. This will make
%   it easier for multiple papers drawn from a single proceedings to have
%   consistent listings. So proceedings are all segregated at the bottom of
%   the file. These proceedings all have crossrefonly=1 fields, except for
%   proceedings that I editted.
% 
%   N.B.: THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU CLIP A CONFERENCE PAPER OUT OF HERE, YOU
%   SHOULD MAKE SURE TO CLIP OUT ITS PROCEEDINGS ENTRY, AS WELL. Or alter
%   its crossref link to your own entry for its containing proceedings.
% 
% - Dependencies
%   + To help make it easier to clip out entries, I have *avoided* the usual
%     game of defining string variables for standard conference & journal
%     names. There are *no such* dependencies in these entries. (But you can
%     mutate them as you like to use your own conventions.)
%
%   + The few URLs that are listed are given using the \url{...} LaTeX form,
%     which means they can be typeset reasonably. This means you'll have to
%     say \usepackage{url} to use these items. Warning: bibtex breaks lines,
%     which as far as I can see, it has no business doing. It will break
%     long urls, terminating the end of line with a % in an attempt to render
%     the linebreak null&void. Modern url.sty packages will actually deal
%     with this properly. If your url.sty keeps this spurious % in the url
%     (e.g., of the long cs.cmu.edu urls), you should either upgrade your
%     url.sty or insert a couple of blanks into the url, which \url will
%     ignore.
% 
% - I've used key-name conventions I took from Olivier Danvy, which he,
%   in turn, seems to have taken from people like Andrzej Filinksi. Going
%   with some kind of convention, I hope, will make it easier to fold these
%   entries into other people's dbs.
% 
% - With a few exceptions, I have not provided URLs. URLs just aren't
%   long-lived enough. If only we had real URI's. Lots and lots of these
%   papers are on the net; try a search engine if you're looking for one.
% 
% - What's with the % in col 1 of these comments? BibTeX doesn't have a
%   comment character. I did that to visually mark comments for humans.
