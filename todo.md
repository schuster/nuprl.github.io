For Pubs
========

* check for duplicate pubs among the ones I'm adding
* figure out which pubs should be listed at all (comment out others)
* fix the years (should be ints, not strings)
* check that year ordering is correct
* lookup venue and do that correctly
* add URLs for everything (maybe...)
* fix latex macros for titles and authors (Unicode issues?)
  * maybe just one-off those into the rkt file
* add package dependency on the bibtex thing
* get rid of weird latex encodings
* fix venues for Mitch pubs
* fix super-long author lines
* include only papers written while author was at NU
